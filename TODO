- fix the return value for commands 
  - this should make reification possible, and also
  - this should make the labels the same datatype

- look at the relevant views framework properties for: reification, interpretation of labels, and the axioms (i.e. everything in the main soundness theorem)

- define reification up to Tom's states (in terms of collapse etc., as currently but go a bit further)

- define the interpretation of the labels ([[a]](s)) - link it up to tom's relation

- state the soundness theorem from the views framework (definition 11 in views paper), in HOL, in our context

- add all the axioms, and put all the axioms in a unified definition

- prove it

- prove the relevant views framework properties for: reification, etc. (the things "looked at" above)

- write the paper that says: this theorem implies good stuff as per views framework results
