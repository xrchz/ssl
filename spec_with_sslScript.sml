We want to set up the connection between Hoare triples from ssl, and transitions
from fs_spec.

Hoare triples describe triples: (s,cmd,s')

Transitions describe tiples: (t,lbl,(t',ev))

The cmd is a program command, and can contain free program vars (which are
constrained by the state s). The cmd also contains a reference to a variable r,
which holds the result of the cmd (>=0 for success, or -1 for error; commands
such as stat etc, which return non-integers, have not yet been formalized). The
state s also contains a global errno, which holds an integer indentifying the
particular error that occurred.

The transition system is somewhat simpler: the value ev is either an error, or a
return value. Return values can be ints, stats, etc. - see ret_value type
definition in fs_specScript.sml

We want to map from Hoare triples to transitions. 

  * To map s to t, we keep only the instrumented filesystem part of s, and we
    "assemble" this into a directory tree (assemble needs to be defined).

  * To map the cmd to a label, suppose the cmd is of the form (Mkdir r p). r is
    a program var which will hold the result of the cmd. p is a program
    variable, but the state s will constrain this to be a path (essentially a
    list of names). The resulting label is MKDIR(f p,dummy_perms), where f maps
    paths in ssl to strings (insert / at beginning if absolute path and between
    entries), and dummy_perms is some dummy value for permissions (we don't deal
    with permissions yet).

  * To map s' to t', we need knowledge of the program variable r. Then s'
    constrains r to be either 0 (for success) or -1 (for error; at the moment
    all triples have r=0). t' is constructed from s' in the same way that t is
    constructed from s. And the return value/error ev is "similarly constructed"
    from the state s' (at the moment it is always None1, corresponding to a
    successful call, but eventually it will have to take account of the errno,
    and different possible return types).
